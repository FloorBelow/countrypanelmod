Politics panel:
Interest Groups show parties, leaders, leader ideologies, and approval
Movements are clickable, and show agitators and revolution progress
Law changes are highlighted instead of being an extra box, and institution levels are shown as pips beneath law icons
Compacted stuff down a bit so that everything but the the bottom economy law is generally visible without scrolling on 1080p screens (curse you land reform for making the categories unbalanced)


Stuff to note:
If you're using a mod that adds more interest groups they might go offscreen, though even if you are it's pretty hard to get more than 8 non-marginalized interest groups so it'll probably still be fine

Only has english localization, feel free to upload your own translation if you want
